#August 31 @ 12PM

####Prototek in Downtown OKC
*401 NW 10th St, Oklahoma City, OK*

After a short summer break from MaptimeOKC, we are back with a fantastic meetup:

##Presenting OKMaps.org

August will be a great meetup where we get to learn about OKMaps.org!

This is an organization that is helping collect GIS data from all around our State and provide it for free to everyone!

Lets support this great Open Data initiative and have a big crowd to learn all about it!

See you there!
