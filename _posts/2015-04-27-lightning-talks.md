#April 27 @ 12PM

####Oseberg Office in Downtown OKC
*12 E California Ave #200, Oklahoma City, OK*

We had a great turnout for Devin Clark's [presentation](http://devinclark.github.io/maptime-okc-leaflet) on leaflet! Thanks to all who attended!

This month, we are relying on you all for our presentations. That's right, it's time for some lightning talks. We want to hear (and see) what you all are doing with mapping! If you want to present, please sign up [here](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-OKC/messages/boards/thread/48885579)

The meetup will be at Oseberg again in Bricktown. The entrance to Oseberg is on the North side of the building directly to the right of the Zios' main entrance (the blue marker). We will have someone in the lobby to let everyone in from the outside (if not, there is a buzzer on the right side of the door).

Check out the map below to find a place to park!

Can't wait to see everyone on April 27th!
