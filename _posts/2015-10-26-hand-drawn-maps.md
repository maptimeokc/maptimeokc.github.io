#October 26 @ 12PM

####Prototek in Downtown OKC
*401 NW 10th St, Oklahoma City, OK*

We are tossing away the tech for this month and doing some arts and crafts:

##Hand Drawn Maps

October is going to be a fantastic and (hopefully) fun meetup to hand draw some maps

We will be taking a break from learning about map styles and cool map data to make our own maps.

Weâ€™ll provide the pencils and paper, just come hungry and get ready to have some fun!

Hope to see you all there!
