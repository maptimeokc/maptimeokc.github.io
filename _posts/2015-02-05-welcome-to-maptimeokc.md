We're paving the way for a Oklahoma City chapter of [Maptime](http://maptime.io) -- a monthly meetup to learn map making. Maptime begins with a talk followed by independent or collaborative work on projects.

If you're interested in learning more, [watch the project](https://gitbhub.com/maptimeokc/maptimeokc.github.io) on GitHub or stay tuned to this site for more updates. At the moment, we're nailing down a venue that can accomodate a monthly meetup.

We're looking at places within the downtown vicinity. If you have a suggestion, let us know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maptimeokc).
