This month, Luke Simkins will be giving a presentation titled:

## AN INTRODUCTION TO WEB VISUALIZATION

This talk will cover the basics of visualization on the web.

Maps are great at allowing quick interpretation of large amounts of information. There are a large number of web-based tools that make creating visualizations easy. This talk will show off a few of these tools, such as d3 and leaflet. Weâ€™ll also touch on some of the most common types of visualizations and best practices when creating them.

See you there!
